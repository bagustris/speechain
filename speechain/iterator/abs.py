    Iterator object cannot directly access the data instances in the built- in Dataset
    object but maintains a batching view of the indices of the data instances used for
    model training or testing.

    The initialization of the built-in Dataset object is done automatically during the initialization of the iterator.
    At the beginning of each epoch, the iterator generates a `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` object to fetch the batches
    of data instances from the disk.

    The iterators are divided into 3 groups: train, valid, and test. In each group, 2 or more iterator objects can be
    constructed so that there could be multiple data-label pairs in a single batch.
