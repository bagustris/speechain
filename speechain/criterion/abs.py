    in this toolkit. It serves the role of evaluating the model forward calculation
    results. Its output can be either a loss function used for training or an evaluation
    metric used for validation.

    This base class has two abstract interface functions: criterion_init() for criterion initialization and __call__()
    for criterion forward calculation.
    1. __call__() must be overridden if you want to make your own Criterion implementation.
    2. criterion_init() is not mandatory to be overridden because some criteria can directly be applied to the input data
        without any initialization such as speechain.criterion.accuracy.Accuracy.
