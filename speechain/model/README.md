## Configuration File Format
The configuration of your model is given in *train_cfg*. 
The configuration format is shown below.
```yaml
model:
    model_type: {file_name}.{class_name}
    model_conf:
        init: {init_function}
        frozen_modules:
            - {frozen_module1}
            - {frozen_module2}
            - ...
        pretrained_model:
            - path: {model_path1}
              mapping: 
                {src_name1}: {tgt_name1}
                {src_name2}: {tgt_name2}
                ...
            - path: {model_path2}
            - ...
        visual_infer_conf:
            ...
        customize_conf: 
            {customize_arg1}: {arg_value1}
            {customize_arg2}: {arg_value2}
            ...
    module_conf:
        ...
    criterion_conf:
        ...    
```
The first-level key must be **model** to notify the framework of the model configuration.  

  1. **model_type** is used as the query to pick up your target *Model* subclass in `{SPEECHAIN_ROOT}/speechain/model/` for model initialization.
  Your given query should be in the form of `{file_name}.{class_name}`, e.g., `asr.ASR` means the subclass `ASR` in `{SPEECHAIN_ROOT}/speechain/model/asr.py`.
  
  2. **model_conf** contains the general configuration of your model. It is made up of the following 5 parts:

      1. **init** indicates the function used to initialize the parameters of your model before training. 
      The available initialization functions are shown in the keys of the built-in dictionary `init_class_dict`.  
      For more details about the available initialization functions, please refer to the built-in dictionary `init_class_dict`.

      2. **frozen_modules** contains the names of the modules that don't need to be updated during training. 
      If a list of module names is given, all those modules will be frozen. 

      3. **pretrained_model** contains the pretrained models you would like to load into your model as the initial parameters. 
      If a list of pretrained models is given, all those pretrained models will be used to initialize your model.  
         1. **path** indicates where the pretrained model file is placed.
         2. **mapping** is a dictionary used to solve the mismatch between the parameter names of the pretrained model and the model you want to train. 
         Each key-value item solves a name mismatch where the key is the name in the pretrained model and the value is the name in the model to be trained.

      4. **visual_infer_conf** contains the inference configuration you want to use for model visualization during training. 
         This argument is default to be an empty dictionary which means the default inference configuration of each model will be used.  
         For more details, please refer to the docstring of `inference()` of each _Model_ subclass.

      5. **customize_conf** will be used to initialize the main body of the model in the interface function *module_init()*.  
         For more details about the argument setting, please refer to the README.md of each _Model_ subclass.
    
  3. **module_conf** contains all the configuration about the module initialization. 
  These configuration arguments will be used to initialize the network structure of the model in the interface function *module_init()*.  
  For more details about the argument setting, please refer to the README.md of each _Model_ subclass.

  4. **criterion_conf** contains all the information about the criterion initialization. 
  These configuration arguments will be used to initialize all the criteria of the model in the interfance function *criterion_init()*.  
  For more details about the argument setting, please refer to the README.md of each _Model_ subclass.

### speechain.model.abs.Model
_speechain.model.abs.Model_ is the base class for all models in this toolkit. 
The main job of a model includes:   

1. (optional) preprocess the input batch data to the trainable format  
2. calculate the model prediction results by the _Module_ members  
3. evaluate the prediction results by the _Criterion_ members  
 
Each model has several built-in _Module_ members that make up the neural network structure of the model. 
These _Module_ members will be initialized by the `module_conf` given in your configuration.

There are a built-in dictionary named `init_class_dict` and a built-in list named `default_init_modules` in the base class.
`init_class_dict` contains all the available initialization functions of the model parameters while `default_init_modules` includes the network layers that have their own initialization functions.

#### \_\_init__(self, args, device, model_conf, module_conf, criterion_conf) 

* **Description:**  
    In this initialization function, there are two parts of initialization: model-specific customized initialization and model-independent general initialization.

    1. Model-specific customized initialization is done by two interface functions: `module_init()` and `criterion_init()`. 
    `module_init()` initializes the neural network structure of the model while `criterion_init()` initializes the criteria used to optimize (loss functions) and evaluate (validation metrics) the model.

    2. After the customized initialization, there are 3 steps for general initialization shared by all _Model_ subclasses:
       1. Pretrained parameters will be loaded into your model if the key `pretrained_model` is given. 
       Multiple pretrained models can be specified and each of them can be loaded into different parts of your model. 
       The mismatch between the names of pretrained parameters and the parameters of your model is handled by the key `mapping`. 
       The value of the key `mapping` is a dictionary where each key-value item corresponds to a mapping of parameter names. 
       The key is the parameter name in the pretrained parameters while the value is the parameter name of your model.

       2. If `pretrained_model` is not given, the parameters of your model will be initialized by the function that matches your input query `init`. 
       For more details about the available initialization functions, please refer to the built-in dictionary `init_class_dict`. 
       If `init` is not given, the default initialization function `torch.nn.init.xavier_normal_` will be used to initialize your model.

       3. Finally, the specified parts of your model will be frozen if `frozen_modules` is given. 
       If there is only one frozen module, you can directly give the string of its name to `frozen_modules` like `frozen_modules: {module_name}`. 
       If there are multiple modules you want to freeze, you can give their names in a list as

          ```yaml
          frozen_modules:
           - {module_name1}
           - {module_name2}
           - ...
          ```
  
       Moreover, the frozen granularity depends on your input `frozen_modules`. For example,  
        1. If you give `frozen_modules: encoder_prenet`, all parameters of the prenet of your encoder will be frozen  
        2. If you give `frozen_modules: encoder_prenet.conv`, only the convolution layers of the prenet of your encoder will be frozen  
        3. If you give `frozen_modules: encoder_prenet.conv.0`, only the first convolution layer of the prenet of your encoder will be frozen  
        4. If you give `frozen_modules: encoder_prenet.conv.0.bias`, only the bias vector of the first convolution layer of the prenet of your encoder will be frozen

ðŸ‘†[Back to the API list](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/tree/main/speechain/model#api-document)

#### inference(self, infer_conf, **kwargs)
* **Description:**  
    This function receives the test data and test configuration. 
    The inference results will be packaged into a _Dict[str, Dict]_ which is passed to the _TestMonitor_ object for disk storage. 
    The returned _Dict_ should be in the form of
    ```python
    dict(
        {file_name}=dict(
            format={file_format},
            content={file_content}
        )
    )
    ```
    
    The first-level key is used to decide the name of the meta file as `idx2{file_name}`. 
    Its value is also a _Dict_ and there must be two keys in this sub-_Dict_: `format` and `content`. 
    The configuration of the sub-_Dict_ is different for different file formats:
    1. For pure text metadata files, the value of `format` must be `txt` and the value of `content` must be a _List_ of Python built-in data type (i.e.,. int, float, str, bool, ...).
    Each line of the file `idx2{file_name}` will be made up of the index of a test data instance and its metadata value in the `content` _List_ which are separated by a blank.  
    For example, `dict(cer=dict(format='txt', content=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3]))` will create a pure text file named `idx2cer` which looks like  
        ```
        {test_index1} 0.1
        {test_index2} 0.2
        {test_index3} 0.3
        ```
        **Note:** if the first-level key ends with _.md_, there will not be _'idx2'_ attached at the beginning of the file name.

    2. For audio files, the value of `format` must be either `wav` or `flac` and the value of `content` must be a _List_ of array-like data type (e.g. numpy.ndarry, torch.Tensor, ...).
    Moreover, there must be an additional key named `sample_rate` to indicate the sampling rate of the waveforms to be saved in audio files.
    There will be a folder named `{file_name}` that contains all the audio files and a pure text file named `idx2{file_name}` that contains the absolute paths of all the saved audio files.  
    For example, `dict(wav=dict(format='flac', content=[np_arr1, np_arr2, np_arr3]))` will create a folder named `wav` and a pure text file named `idx2wav` in the same directory. 
    The file `idx2wav` looks like:
         ```
         {test_index1} /x/xx/wav/{test_index1}.flac
         {test_index2} /x/xx/wav/{test_index2}.flac
         {test_index3} /x/xx/wav/{test_index3}.flac
         ```
         where `/x/xx/` is your result path given in your `exp_cfg`.

    3. For binary files, the value of `format` in the sub-_Dict_ must be `npy` and the value of `content` must be a _List_ of numpy.ndarry (torch.Tensor is not supported).
    There will be a folder named `{file_name}` that contains all the _.npy_ files and a pure text file named `idx2{file_name}` that contains the absolute paths of all the saved binary files.  
    For example, `dict(feat=dict(format='npy', content=[np_arr1, np_arr2, np_arr3]))` will create a folder named `feat` and a pure text file named `idx2feat`. 
    The `idx2feat` file is like:
       ```
       {test_index1} /x/xx/feat/{test_index1}.npy
       {test_index2} /x/xx/feat/{test_index2}.npy
       {test_index3} /x/xx/feat/{test_index3}.npy
       ```
       where `/x/xx/` is your result path given in your `exp_cfg`.
* **Arguments:**
    * _**infer_conf:**_ Dict  
      The configuration Dict used for model inference.
    * _****kwargs:**_  
      The testing data loaded from `test` dataloader object in the experimental pipeline. 
* **Return:** Dict[str, Dict[str, str or List]]  
    The model inference results to be saved on the disk.

1. [ASR Recipes](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/tree/main/recipes/asr#automatic-speech-recognition-asr)  
    1. [asr.ARASR](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/blob/main/speechain/model/asr.py#L29)  
        * **Structure:** Auto-Regressive CTC-Attention ASR model.  
        * **Input:** One tuple of speech-text paired data (_feat_, _feat_len_, _text_, _text_len_) in _model_forward()_.  
        * **Output:** One ASR loss calculated on the input data tuple in _criterion_calculation()_.
    2. [asr.SemiARASR](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/blob/main/speechain/model/asr.py#L658) 
        * **Structure:** Semi-supervised Auto-Regressive CTC-Attention ASR model.  
        * **Input:** Multiple tuples of speech-text paired data  (_feat_, _feat_len_, _text_, _text_len_) in _model_forward()_. 
        Each of them is generated by a specific `torch.utils.data.Dataloader`.
        * **Output:** Multiple ASR losses calculated on all the input data tuples in _criterion_calculation()_. 
        A loss named _loss_ is also returned which is the trainable overall loss summed by all ASR losses. 
2. [TTS Recipes](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/tree/main/recipes/tts#text-to-speech-synthesis-tts)  
    1. [tts.ARTTS](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/blob/main/speechain/model/tts.py#L36)
        * **Structure:** Auto-Regressive Attention TTS model.  
        * **Input:** One tuple of speech-text paired data (_feat_, _feat_len_, _text_, _text_len_) in _model_forward()_.  
        * **Output:** One TTS loss calculated on the input data tuple in _criterion_calculation()_.

## How to Freeze a Specific Part of your Model
Parameter freezing can be done simply by giving the name of the module you want to freeze in _frozen_modules_. 
In the example below, the encoder of the ASR model will be frozen while other modules are still trainable.
```yaml
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        frozen_modules: encoder
```
If you want to freeze multiple modules, you can give their names as a list in _frozen_modules_. 
In the example below, the prenets of both the encoder and decoder will be frozen.
```yaml
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        frozen_modules:
          - encoder.prenet
          - decoder.prenet
```
The parameter freezing granularity can be very fine if you specify the module name by a series of dots. 
In the example below, the convolution layers of the prenet of the encoder will be frozen.
```yaml
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        frozen_modules: 
            - encoder.prenet.conv
```

## How to Initialize your Model by the Pretrained Model
Pretrained model loading can be easily done by giving the model path in _pretrained_model_. 
In the example below, the entire ASR model will be initialized by the given _best_accuracy.pth_ model.
```yaml
mdl_root: recipe/asr/librispeech/train-clean-100/exp/{exp_name}/models
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        pretrained_model:
            path: !ref <mdl_root>/accuracy_best.pth
```
If you only want to initialize a part of your model, you can use the _mapping_ argument in _pretrained_model_. 
The parameter name mismatch can also be solved by the _mapping_ argument. 
In the example below, only the encoder of the ASR model will be initialized by the given pretrained model. 
Even though the pretrained model is constructed by unit modules, it can still be loaded into the ASR model constructed by template modules by aligning their module names.
```yaml
model_root: recipe/asr/librispeech/train-clean-100/exp/{exp_name}/models
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        pretrained_model:
            path: !ref <model_root>/accuracy_best.pth
            mapping: 
              encoder_prenet: encoder.prenet
              encoder: encoder.encoder
```
There could be multiple pretrained models in _pretrained_model_ that are used to initialize your model. 
In the example below, the encoder and decoder of the ASR model are initialized by different pretrained models.

Note that if there are overlapping modules between the _mapping_ arguments of different pretrained models, 
the module will be initialized by the pretrained models at the back of the list.
```yaml
model_root: recipe/asr/librispeech/train-clean-100/exp/{exp_name}/models
model:
    model_type: asr.ARASR
    model_conf:
        pretrained_model:
            - path: !ref <model_root>/accuracy_best.pth
              mapping:
                encoder_prenet: encoder.prenet
                encoder: encoder.encoder
            - path: !ref <model_root>/10_accuracy_average.pth
              mapping:
                decoder_prenet: decoder.prenet
                decoder: decoder.decoder
                decoder_postnet: decoder.postnet
```
