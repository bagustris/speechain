# OptimScheduler 

[*OptimScheduler*](https://github.com/bagustris/SpeeChain/blob/main/speechain/optim_sche/abs.py) is the base class of all _OptimScheduler_ objects that combine the roles of traditional optimizers and schedulers together. 
Its main job is optimizing the target model parameters and scheduling the learning rate during training.  
In this toolkit, we combine traditional optimizers and schedulers into a single class: OptimScheduler. 
Each _OptimScheduler_ object has one built-in member optimizer (`torch.optim.Optimizer`) which is initialized automatically by the `optim_type` and `optim_conf` given in your configuration.

## Configuration File Format
The configuration of *OptimScheduler* is given in the `optim_sches` tag of *train_cfg*. 
The configuration format is shown below.
```yaml
optim_sches:
    type: {file_name}.{class_name}
    conf:
        optim_type: {class_name}
        optim_conf:
            ...
        # general optimscheduler configuration
        optim_loss:
        updated_modules:
        step_per_update:
        # customized optimscheduler configuration
        ...
```

* The first-level key must be **optim_sches** to notify the framework of the optimscheduler configuration.  

    1. **type** is a second-level key that indicates your optimscheduler type. 
    The value of this key is used as the query to pick up your target *OptimScheduler* subclass for initialization.   
    Your given query should be in the form of `file_name.class_name` to indicate the place of your target subclass.  
    For example, `noam.NoamLr` means the class `NoamLr` in `./speechain/optim_sche/noam.py`.  

    2. **conf** is a second-level key that indicates your optimscheduler configuration. 
    The value of this key is a _Dict_ whose configuration is as following:

          1. **optim_type** is a query that indicates the type of the built-in `torch.optim.Optimizer` in this optimscheduler.  
          Your given query should be in the form of `class_name` to indicate your target subclass in `torch.optim`.  
          For example, `Adam` means the class `torch.optim.Adam`.

          2. **optim_conf** contains all the configuration used to initialize the built-in optimizer.  
            For more details, please refer to the [_PyTorch_ document](https://pytorch.org/docs/1.2.0/optim.html#algorithms) of your target `torch.optim.Optimizer` subclass.  

          3. **optimscheduler general configuration** is shared by all _OptimScheduler_ subclasses.  
                1. optim_loss  
                2. updated_modules  
                3. step_per_update  

          4. **optimscheduler customized configuration** is used to initialize the customized part of each optimscheduler subclass. 
          This part defines the scheduling strategy to adjust the learning rates during training.  
          Please refer to the docstrings of your target *OptimScheduler* subclass for more details.

## How to Construct Multiple Optimizers on Multiple Losses
The cooperation of multiple optimizers is handled by 3 arguments: _optim_losses_, _updated_modules_, and _step_per_update_.  

1. _optim_losses_ means the training loss used to calculate the gradients for the optimizer.   

2. _update_modules_ means the target module in your where that you would like the optimizer to update the parameters.  

3. _step_per_update_ means the updating frequency of the optimizer (i.e. the parameter optimization can be done once per _step_per_update_ steps).

In the example below, there are two optimschedulers for optimizing the parameters of an Encoder-Decoder model. 
_encoder_optim_ optimizes the encoder part using the training loss called _encoder_loss_ while _decoder_optim_ optimizes the decoder part using the training loss called _decoder_loss_. 
The encoder optimization is done once every 2 steps while the decoder optimization is done once every step.
```yaml
optim_sches:
    encoder_optim:
        type: noam.NoamLr
        conf:
            optim_type: Adam
            optim_conf:
                ...
            optim_losses: encoder_loss
            updated_modules: encoder
            step_per_update: 2

    decoder_optim:
        type: noam.NoamLr
        conf:
            optim_type: Adam
            optim_conf:
                ...
            optim_losses: decoder_loss
            updated_modules: decoder
```

## How to Simulate Large Batch Training with Limited GPUs
We provide a method called gradient accumulation (implemented by the argument `accum_grad` in _exp_cfg_) to train your model with large batches that are beyond the memory of your GPUs. 
The basic idea is to accumulate the gradients calculated in several small batches and update the model with the accumulated gradients to mimic a large batch. 
So, the actual batch size becomes `accum_grad * batch_size`.

The pseudo-code of gradient accumulation is like this:
```python
for step in range(max_step):
    loss /= accum_grad
    loss.backward()
    if step % accum_grad == 0:
        # real_step = (step - 1) // accum_grad + 1
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```
Let me show you an intuitive example. 
Suppose we want to calculate the mean value of 1, 2, ..., 9, 10 but we cannot directly divide the sum by 10 because our calculator is not powerful enough. 
Instead, we can calculate the mean value of two sub-groups: 1, 2, .., 5 and 6, 7, ..., 10. 
We get two sub-mean values: 3 and 8. 
The overall mean value can be calculated by taking the mean value of these two sub-mean values: (3 + 8) / 2 = 5.5

Unfortunately, gradient accumulation is not identical to large batch training. 
Since small batches are used to calculate the gradients of each step, some calculations of large batch training cannot be simulated (e.g. _BatchNorm_ and _FeatureNormalization_). 
Therefore, the performance of the model trained by gradient accumulation may be slightly different from the one trained by the actual large batches.

## How to Perform Fine-tuning
In the normal setting, we need to scale down the learning rates by a factor of 10 to 100 for fine-tuning a pretrained model. 
In this toolkit, the learning rates can be easily scaled down by the input argument `ft_factor` in _exp_cfg_ without changing the scheduling configuration of your optimscheduler. 
It's no longer necessary for you to redesign the scheduler configuration for fine-tuning!
