## Preparing Durations for FastSpeech2
For training a FastSpeech2 model, you need to acquire additional duration data for your target dataset. 
Follow these steps:
1. Create a virtual environment for MFA: `conda create -n speechain_mfa -c conda-forge montreal-forced-aligner gdown`.
2. Activate the `speechain_mfa` environment: `conda activate speechain_mfa`.
3. Downsample your target TTS dataset to 16khz. For details, please see [how to dump a dataset on your machine](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/tree/main/datasets#how-to-dump-a-dataset-on-your-machine).
4. By default, MFA package will store all the temporary files to your user directory. If you lack sufficient space, add `export MFA_ROOT_DIR={your-target-directory}` to `~/.bashrc` and run `source ~/.bashrc`.
5. Navigate to `${SPEECHAIN_ROOT}/datasets` and run `bash mfa_preparation.sh -h` for help. Then, add appropriate arguments to `bash mfa_preparation.sh` to acquire duration data.

**Note:** MFA cannot process duration calculations for multiple datasets concurrently on a single machine (or a single node on a cluster). 
Please process each dataset one at a time.

## Training an TTS model
To train a TTS model, follow the [ASR model training instructions](https://github.com/ahclab/SpeeChain/tree/main/recipes/asr#training-an-asr-model) located in `recipes/asr`. 
Make sure to replace the folder names and configuration file names from `recipes/asr` with their corresponding names in `recipes/tts`.
